# Binary-Search-Trees
Overview
This Java class implements a generic Binary Search Tree (BST) that allows for storing key-value pairs where keys are unique and must implement the Comparable interface. The BST supports basic operations such as insertion, search, deletion, and traversals to find the minimum and maximum keys, as well as checking the size and if the tree is empty.

Features
Generic Types: Works with any type of key that extends Comparable.
Insertion: Add key-value pairs to the tree while maintaining BST properties.
Search: Retrieve values by their keys.
Deletion: Remove nodes by key, including cases with two children using the successor strategy.
Size: Calculate the number of nodes present in the tree.
Check Emptiness: Easily check if the tree is empty.
Minimum and Maximum: Find the smallest and largest keys in the tree.
ToString Representation: Overridden toString method for easy visualization of the tree's contents in a {key=value, ...} format.
